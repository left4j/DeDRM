# Basic info on the conversion script:


### It will convert the newly added book from Kindle and Google Books for you. 
### Will not touch any of the books already present in your library

### You can change: 
* The output formats (by default PDF and EPUB)
* The leftover files removed (by default covers - .png and .jpg and metadata - .opf and .xml). 
  Watch out where you specify the output to go to, as it will delete files with aforementioned extensions in that directory
* Any other shit, like amrgin settings, naming scheme, etc. Refer to [Calibre CLI Documentation](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/cli-index.html) for more info

### All in all, almost every line of code is commented so it's easy to understand what each bit does
